### Reverse proxy
A reverse proxy is a type of server that sits in front of web servers and forwards clients to those web servers. It helps web traffic control, security, performance and reliability. It does this by creating a single point of access, meaning only direct access to the web app servers is through the reverse proxy. As well as concentrates access control on that single point (ensuring if any unauthorized IP connection is immediately terminated)
